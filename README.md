# Snuggle
A statically-typed scripting language that runs embedded in Java!
Extremely work-in-progress.
Codebase/type-checking is very jank, but hey it's my first statically typed language leave me alone ðŸ˜­

Examples maybe coming in the future, once I have some more progress and syntax/semantics are more nailed down
